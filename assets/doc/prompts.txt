Hello! I want to build my CV
# You are an artificial intelligence, you must help me with what is requested, I will be responsible for calibrating you,
testing the code you send me, updating the information in the code and validating it.

# Main Goal:

- I work as a Data Engineer, specializing in Data Science and Analytics and Software Engineering. 
- My professional specialty is developing data-related software products.
- That said, I want to set up a One-page web page with my domain name "viniciusgribas" ('.com' ; '.io' ; .etc...) free of charge.
- Where I can send the url to interested users and they can export them as pdfs.
- The page itself should serve as a portfolio, showcasing my development skills.

# first instructions

1 ) I already have a repository that I cloned from github and I'm using the design provided there to build my own without too much trouble. I'm sending you some images showing the design I'm going to follow.

2) I already have a page on githubpages ( viniciusgribas.github.io) , but I don't like the way it is now and I'm making another one from scratch.

3) Whenever you want a code, ask me and I'll send it to you.

# Our step-by-step will be:
1) Structure the repository I'm using as a template with my curriculum information, editing each of the topics that are in the template. 
e.g.: Step 1 - Updating name, contacts and photo; Step 2 - Updating about me; Step 3 ... etc.

2) You should only move on to another stage when I choose to go to it.

3) At the end of structuring, we will modify details, such as
3.1) include light and dark versions for the page
3.2) Include the option to export as a pdf, so that you can download the file.
