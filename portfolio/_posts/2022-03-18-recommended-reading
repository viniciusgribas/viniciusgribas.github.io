The possibility to automate long and laborious activities in `excel` ; to perform punctual analysis in a spreadsheet; to apply more powerful functions from the pandas and numpy libraries in excel; and even to use macros that were previously only exclusive to `VBA EXCEL`. These are the main points that are motivating my current object of study. The integration between `Excel` and `Python`. Besides these articles, I highlight the book **"Python for Excel" by Felix Zumstein**. Creator of the `"xlwings"` library.
